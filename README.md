# Chat Web App, made with React

**A simple chat web app, made with Express, React and Socket.io.**

### About

---

Can run on localhost, with the server running on port 3001, and the app running on port 3000.
Open localhost port 3000 on two separate tabs, and both will update in real time with socket.io.

### TODO:

---

-   [x] Get it running on localhost
-   [x] Add an "author" system (who sent it)
-   [ ] Deploy on Heroku
